# Lane-segmentation
• Lane segmentation for self driving cars
– Implemented a lane segmentation system for self-driving cars using deep learning techniques for precise lane boundary
identification.
– Utilized convolutional neural networks (CNNs) to segment lanes in complex driving environments under diverse weather
conditions.
